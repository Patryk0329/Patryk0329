# 👋 Hi, I'm Patryk Hołubowicz

🎓 I'm a third-year Applied Computer Science student at the **AGH University of Krakow** with a strong interest in backend development and cloud technologies. Currently, I'm looking for opportunities to grow my skills in real-world software projects — especially in the .NET ecosystem.

💡 I'm passionate about clean code, learning by doing, and building practical solutions. I’m currently gaining hands-on experience through self-driven projects while continuously expanding my knowledge in C#, .NET, and software architecture.
